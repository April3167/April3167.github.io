							<p>With a core purpose of helping users to understand the context, a water interface provides possibility for enhancing user experience in interaction process. Starting from analyzing existing water-mediated interaction approaches, we proposed a water-mediated interaction design model and a corresponding user experience model, aiming to eliminate the boundary between users and the context with water as the medium. According to the proposed model, we implemented a water-mediated interaction system Landscape Rippling, with the painting “A Panorama of Rivers and Mountains” as its context. Ultimately, user experience tests of the interaction system demonstrate the effectiveness of this water-mediated interaction design model.</p>

							<p>The special characters of water raises to us that how to function water as both an interaction medium and a core context element, in order to eliminate the boundary between users and the context with natural interactions. We propose a water-mediated interaction design model which consists of three layers from abstract to concrete, by analyzing the context, the water as medium and user experience of the state-of-the-art water-mediatoneed interaction approaches </p>

							We also propose one user experience model of water-mediated systems. Users will have a sense of immersion under the presentation layer based on context. The mixed reality technology will help users to build a sense of familiarity and thus immerse themselves in the scenario. Task-oriented induction triggers user’s engagement and interaction. Based on the immersion in the environment, users begin to actively engage in the interaction and devote more attention to it. Finally, the complete water-mediated interaction on the sensory channel triggers the highest level of user experience - imagination and empathy. At this point, users follows the induction to complete the interaction process in an environment based on context. The water medium participates in the input and output of the system to constitute natural interaction, stimulating users to think about the context in a personalized way and build a cognitive understanding.
