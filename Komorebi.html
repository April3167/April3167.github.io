							<p>We participated in 2019 Xiamen Jiahe Cultural and Creative "Echo-Image" exhibition. At the exhibition site, the participants showed great interest in our project, and they also gave favorable comments after the experience.</p>
							<p>During the exhibition, we conducted user interviews. Many of the participants did not know or even had never heard of plant dyeing before the experience. Through our interactive project, they had a preliminary knowledge and understanding of the concept of plant dyeing. Some of the participants expressed that they were interested in plant dyeing through this experience, or they would continue to understand and explore it.</p>
